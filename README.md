P.S. No1 - Command was made for Java, not Bedrock

P.S. No2 - I FORBID changing the code, posting it under YOUR name, showing it on video and not leaving the author's name (is this even possible considering that it stupidly shows it on the whole screen?) and to say that it's yours, but I allow you to use it.

P.S. No3 - Keep in mind that the code is MALICIOUS in its own sense, so some of its versions are able to HARM SYSTEM IN ANY SENCE OR DAMAGE THE SERVER. I DISCLAIM responsibility for all damages caused by the code. Keep this in mind. If you use this code, then you agree with all of the above, there and with the license.


Code (trying hard to) support(s) 1.16.5 versions and above. Some features may not work.

In order for you to kill the server, you need to get a command block with a command. Go into a single-player game, give yourself a command block, 
put it up and type my command in there and click done so that it is saved inside. After that, hold down Ctrl and press MMB, hovering over the block to copy the block with the NBT tag. 

Take out the wooden pressure plate (or redstone block) and the anvil from the inventory (I'll tell you about the anvil later). 
Command block in 1 slot, pressure plate (or redstone block) in 2, anvil in 3. Press C + [0-9] to save your hotbar. 
After that, you can press X + [the number you saved the hotbar to] to download the hotbar. Or you can manually take the command block from there.

To launch a command, it's not enough just to power up the command unit - it will flood the armorstand with a bunch of passengers. 
Break the armorstand, and then the command will start working. 

The command takes up a huge amount of RAM by instantly igniting and creating a 10x10x1 TNT grid. The fact is that lit TNT in Minecraft is considered an entity, and a small amount of RAM is charged for processing the entity. 
Let's say 1MB (I really don't know, just assume). In minecraft, a second is a tick, and in 1 second there are (usually) 20. 1 command is processed every 1 tick. Therefore, my 10x10 TNT grid produces 100 TNT per 1 tick, and 2000 TNT per second (100x20). 
The average person who has never seen anything like this is unlikely to think quickly about how to exit the game or pull the plug out of the socket in order to turn off the computer. 
Let's say it takes 5 seconds for him to realize that he's fucked. 2000 multiplied by 5 will be 10000. 10GB of RAM will be requested by Minecraft at this moment. 
Usually, Minecraft is allocated around 4GB of RAM, so it will stupidly freeze, and the server will come to an end. Of course, if someone will load command blocks. Give yourself the name dw13GUr (my name, the name of the creator), 
and you will be teleported away, but not close to the command blocks. You'll be far enough away not to render entities, but (maybe) load the command blocks. 

Ordinary players can't get and give themselves command blocks, so you need to come up with something. If the server is just a self-embodiment of laziness and greed, then you can use certain software to hack access to the server and the operator's role. 
After that, you can give yourself anything and crash the server. If this is a LAN game or you just don't have these software, then you can try to scam the developer. 
You can tell him that you are an experienced programmer who is looking for fame and support. The fact that your teams can do a lot, such as build statues, portraits, beautiful buildings, mechanisms, or worse. If the developer is a dumb-ass jerk, 
then he will give you a creative or even a role, but at the same time you need an operator and or a person who has permission to do this to put the command block. 
Just throw him your command block with the NBT tag and tell him to put it down, then quickly put it next to the command block (but not on it) and throw a wooden slab on it (or stand on it) and quickly break the armorstand. 
If the developer is not dumb enough to put a command block, but dumb enough to believe you, then take out an anvil and write smart shit there. Similar to <144...{"playerName"}:{"Retard"}...>

That's all. Have fun.
