I was typing all this for around 3 years. Unfortunately, during this time, servers with minecraft just cruelly started disappearing on Radmin VPN, and now I have nothing to raid. 
So I've wasted 3 years? Honestly, even if that's the case, I don't give a fuck. The main thing is that I have finished, the rest is unimportant. 
Most of the time was spent studying the material, for example, I learned about replaceitem or screening quite recently.
Soon I want to add a real partboard with various nonsense and text above the inventory, although I don't know how yet.
